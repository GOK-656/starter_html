                    <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three
                        different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the
                        neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid
                        the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
                    <p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of
                        his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving
                        his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

                        to my desk
                        to play with me when I do my homework. She frequently likes to rub my side when I watch TV or
                        play on my mobile
                        phone. At the same time, she is also very warm. Every time we have guests over, she gets along
                        well with them.</p>
                    <p>Unlike other cats who are very afraid of going outside, Hua Hua is very interested in exploring
                        the outside world.
                        Whenever my parents are preparing for a walk at the door, she comes and keeps spinning around,
                        expressing her
                        desire to go out with my parents.</p>

                    <p>Pluto is a five-year-old rescue dog of an unknown breed. He was found wandering alone and taken
                        to the
                        Valley Humane Society where he found his new family. From a young age, Pluto always had a
                        special
                        personality, he was known for being very, very lazy! He spends most of his time staring out the
                        window to
                        keep watch of his house. Don’t let the laziness fool you because Pluto defends his family from
                        the
                        mailman and squirrels every single day.</p>
                    <p>Aside from his job as defender of the house, Pluto likes to have fun. Pluto’s favorite part of
                        the day is
                        his daily walk. Sometimes he even gets to go to the park and meet his neighbors. He also loves
                        his toy
                        duck, and only his toy duck. As a dog, it's in his nature to hunt and so he makes sure to get
                        some
                        practice with his toy duck.</p>

                        nose.
                        Rocket is named rocket because he runs so fast and energetically all day without even taking a
                        break.
                        Rocket loves to carry his little toy around the house and jump towards my bed.</p>
                    <p>Rocket is friendly to all human beings. He may be a little shy at first but will 'say hi' to you
                        after a
                        few seconds. He is also friendly to dogs, especially the small breeds, because the large size
                        dogs are
                        hard for him to smell lol. If you meet Rocket, don't hesitate to say hi to him!! He will be
                        super happy
                        the whole day.</p>
