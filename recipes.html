        <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven.</li>
            <li>Season the beef generously with salt, pepper, garlic powder, dried rosemary, and dried thyme. Let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.</li>

            <li>Place the seasoned beef in a roasting pan or on a baking sheet. If desired, you can sear the beef in a hot skillet with some oil for a few minutes on each side before transferring it to the oven.</li>
            <li>Arrange the oiled and seasoned potato chunks or wedges around the beef in the roasting pan or on the baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Place the roasting pan or baking sheet in the preheated oven and roast for about 25-30 minutes per pound.</li>
            <li>Halfway through the cooking time, carefully flip the potatoes with a spatula to ensure even browning.</li>
            <li>Once the beef reaches your desired level of doneness, remove it from the oven and let it rest for about 10-15 minutes before slicing.</li>
            <li>Serve the sliced beef with the roast potatoes and any desired accompaniments such as roasted vegetables, Yorkshire pudding, gravy, or a side salad.</li>
